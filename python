# str type vs unicode type
  1) str: a plain sequence of bytes (in Python3, str is called bytes)
  2) unicode: a general representation of some text, which can be encoded in many different ways
     (text is a sequence of code points which may be bigger than a single byte)
  3) literal strings are unicode by default in Python3, i.e. unicode of Python2 is equivalent to str in Python3
  ex.
    >>> text = 'รก'     <== unicode string in Python3, i.e. text = u'รก'
    >>> len(text)   
        1              <== one code point
    >>> text.encode('utf8')
        b'\xc3\xa1'    <== bytes literal
