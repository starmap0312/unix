# ifconfig
  used to initialize network interfaces and to enable/disable network interfaces
  promiscuous mode: a network card never drops a packet
  MTU(maximun transmission unit): the maximun number of octects the interface can handle in
    one transaction (default: 1500)
  1. ifconfig eth0
  2. ifconfig -a
  3. ifconfig eth0 up (ifup eth0)
  4. ifconfig eth0 down (ifdown eth0)
  5. ifconfig eth0 192.168.2.2 ==> assign the IP address to an interface
  6. ifconfig eth0 promisc, ifconfig eth0 -promisc

# ethtool: view and change ethernet device parameters
  1. ethtool eth0: list ethernet device properties
  2. ethtool -s eth0 autoneg off: turn off auto-negotiation

# default ports:
  SMTP: 25
  DNS: 53
  FTP: 20 (data transfer), 21 (connection established)
  DHCP: 67 (UDP, DHCP server), 63 (UDP, DHCP client)
  SSH: 22
  Squid: 3128

# what is network bonding?
  the aggregation of multiple LAN cards into a single bonded interface to provide fault
    tolerance and high performance (a.k.a NIC teaming)

# how to check default route and routing table?
  netstat -nr: default route
  route -n: routing table

# how to check which port are listening in my system?
  netstat --listen
  lsof -i

# hostname: display the machine's hostname
  hostname -d: display the domain name the machine belongs to
  hostname -f: display the fully qualified host and domain name
  hostname -i: display the IP address for the current machine

# ping: send packets to destination device, the destination device will send packets back
  two purposes: 1. ensure network connection can be established (Layer 3 health check: IP)
                2. timing information such as the speed of the connection
  ex. ping [hostname/host_ip]
 
  ping -c 5 gmail.com ==> ping a remote host by sending only 5 packets

# telnet: used to communicate with a host through the TELNET protocol 
  - often used to check if a host is listening on a port (Layer 7 health check: TELNET)
    ex. telnet [hostname/host_ip] 80
  - send commands to the host, ex. HELO/GET
  - press Ctrl + ] to go back to the interactive mode, then type quit to exit
 
# nc: arbitrary TCP and UDP connections and listens
  - often used to check if a host is listening on a port (Layer 4 health check: TCP/UDP)
    options:
     -w: timeout, if connection/stdin are idle for timeout seconds, then connection is closed
     -v: verbose output
    ex. nc -w 1 [hostname/host_ip] 4080 -v

# netstat: finding information of connection to and from the host
   netstat -a: display all connections including TCP and UDP connections
   netstat -t: display only TCP connection
   netstat -u: display only UDP connection
   netstat -g: display all multicast network subscribed by this host
   ex. how to find which remote hosts are connecting to you on a particular port, ex. 10123?
       command: netstat -a | grep "10123"

# nslookup: query Internet name servers interactively
  1. find the hostname in your network using an IP address, or vice versa?
    nslookup [host_ip]
    nslookup [hostname]
  2. find all IP addresses for a given domain name
    nslookup www.google.com

# traceroute: view the number of hops and response time to get to a remote system

# finger: view user information such as user login name/real time/terminal name/write status
 
# what is private IP?
  there are 3 IP ranges reserved for private address that are not valid for internet use
  class A: 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 (256 * 256 * 256)
  class B: 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 (16 * 256 * 256)
  class C: 198.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 (256 * 256)

# what is the benefit of subnetting?
  provide a way to secure network traffic by isolating it from the rest of network
  reduce network traffic (broadcast traffic can be isolated within a single logical network)
  reduce the size of routing table

# what is the difference between static and dynamic IPs?
  static IP: IP address is configured to the same IP address
  dynamic IP: IP address may change periodically and is managed by a centralized network device

# what is DHCP scope?
  a range or pool of IP addresses that can be leased to DHCP clients on a given subnet

# what is FQDN?
  fully qualified domain name which contains both hostname and domain name
  it uniquely identifies a host within a DNS hierarchy

# what is the DNS forwarder?
  DNS servers often need to communicate with DNS servers outside of the local network
  when a DNS server receives DNS queries that it cannot resolve locally, it then forwards
  the queries to external DNS servers for resolution
