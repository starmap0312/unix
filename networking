1. hostname: display the machine's hostname
   hostname -d: display the domain name the machine belongs to
   hostname -f: display the fully qualified host and domain name
   hostname -i: display the IP address for the current machine

2. ping: send packets to destination device, the destination device will send packets back
   once recevied
   two purposes: 1. ensure network connection can be established
                 2. timing information such as the speed of the connection

3. ifconfig: network configuration (current network adapter configuration)
 
4. netstat: finding information of connection to and from the host
   netstat -a: display all connections including TCP and UDP connections
   netstat -t: display only TCP connection
   netstat -u: display only UDP connection
   netstat -g: display all multicast network subscribed by this host
   ex. how to find which remote hosts are connecting to you on a particular port, ex. 10123?
       command: netstat -a | grep "10123"

5. nslookup: ip address <-> hostname
   find all IP addresses for a given domain name
   ex. nslookup www.google.com

6. traceroute: view the number of hops and response time to get to a remote system

7. finger: view user information such as user's login name, real time, terminal name, and
       write status
 
8. telnet: connect destination host via telnet protocol
   telnet "hostname" "port"

9. what is private IP?
   there are 3 IP ranges reserved for private address that are not valid for internet use
   class A: 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 (256 * 256 * 256)
   class B: 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 (16 * 256 * 256)
   class C: 198.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 (256 * 256)

10. what is the benefit of subnetting?
   provide a way to secure network traffic by isolating it from the rest of network
   reduce network traffic (broadcast traffic can be isolated within a single logical network)
   reduce the size of routing table

11. what is the difference between static and dynamic IPs?
   static IP: IP address is configured to the same IP address
   dynamic IP: IP address may change periodically and is managed by a centralized network device

12. what is DHCP scope?
   a range or pool of IP addresses that can be leased to DHCP clients on a given subnet

13. what is FQDN?
   fully qualified domain name which contains both hostname and domain name
   it uniquely identifies a host within a DNS hierarchy

14. what is the DNS forwarder?
   DNS servers often need to communicate with DNS servers outside of the local network
   when a DNS server receives DNS queries that it cannot resolve locally, it then forwards
   the queries to external DNS servers for resolution
