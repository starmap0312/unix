# rsync: remote sync, synchronize the files and directories from one location to another
  replicate the whole content between source and destination (local or remote) directories
  - speed: transfers only the changed blocks or bytes
  - security: allows encryption of data using ssh protocol
  - less bandwidth: uses compression and decompression of data
  ex.
  1. sync two local folders
    rsync -zvr /path/to/local/folder1/ /path/to/local/folder2/
    (-z: enable compression, -v: verbose, -r: recursive mode)
    (rsync does not preserve timestamps)
  2. sync with preservation of timestamps, symbolic links, and permissions, etc.
    rsync -avz /path/to/local/folder1/ /path/to/local/folder2/
    (-a: recursive mode, preserves symbolic links, permissions, timestamps, and owners and groups)
  3. sync only one file
    rsync -v /path/to/local/file /path/to/local/folder/
  4. sync to remote system, and vice versa
    rsync -avz /path/to/local/folder/ username@10.1.168.72:/path/to/remote/folder/
    rsync -avz username@10.1.168.72:/path/to/remote/folder/ /path/to/local/folde
r/
    Password: xxxxx (password required)
    (you can set up passwordless login to bypass the entering of passwords)
  5. enable the secured remote connection
    rsync -avz -e ssh username@10.1.168.72:/path/to/remote/folder/ /path/to/local/folder/
  6. do not overwrite the modified files at the destination
    rsync -avzu /path/to/local/folder/ username@10.1.168.72:/path/to/remote/folder/
  7. sync only the directory tree structure (not the files)
    rsync -v -d /path/to/local/folder/ username@10.1.168.72:/path/to/remote/folder/
  8. delete the target file at the destination if the file not present in the source
    rsync -avz --delete /path/to/local/folder/ username@10.1.168.72:/path/to/remote/folder/
  9. do not create new files at the destination (sync only existing files at the destination)
    rsync -avz --existing /path/to/local/folder/ username@10.1.168.72:/path/to/remote/folder/
 10. include and exclude file patterns
    rsync -avz --include '*.cpp' --exclude '*' /path/to/local/folder/ \
      username@10.1.168.72:/path/to/remote/folder/
    (include files and directories ending with .cpp and exclude all other files)
 11. do not transfer large files
    rsync -avz --max-size='10K' /path/to/local/folder/ username@10.1.168.72:/path/to/remote/folder/
