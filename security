# PAM: Pluggable Authentication Modules for Linux
  /etc/security/pamkeys/
  1) Linux-PAM is a system of libraries that handle the authentication tasks of applications
     (services) on the system
  2) the library provides a stable general interface (Application Programming Interface - API) 
     that privilege granting programs (such as login(1) and su(1)) defer to to perform standard authentication
       tasks.
  3) PAM agent allows a user to use key-based authentication for executing sudo
     cat /etc/pam.d/sudo:
       auth sufficient pam_ssh_agent_auth.so file=/etc/security/pamkeys/%u
       i.e. the PAM agent will use the public keys in /etc/security/pamkeys/<username> for authentication
