# revert to previous commit and make it a new commit
  git rm -r . # remove all files
  git checkout HEAD~3 . # path specifier: overwrite all matching files (all files match dot)
  git commit # make a new commit

# discard unstaged changes of all files
  git checkout .

# git add
  git add -A
  -A, --all: all files in the entire working tree are updated

# git remote add
  1) add the remote repo & push master up to that repo
    git remote add origin git@github.com:username/repo_name.git
    git push origin master
  2) set up the upstream of a forked repo
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY.git
    git remote -v: view all remote repos

# update/sync with upstream branch
  git fetch upstream (fetch upstream repo)
  git checkout master (checkout local master branch)
  git merge upstream/master (merge upstream/master to local master branch)
  git push origin master (push local master branch to forked personal GitHub)

# git push
  git push origin branch_name (push local branch_name to remote repo)
  git push == git push origin master
  
# create local branch and push to remote
  git checkout -b branch_name
  (create a local branch which is a duplicate of the master branch)
  git push -u origin branch_name
  (create a local and isolated branch)
  git checkout --orphan branch_name
  (push local branch to remote)
  git branch -a 
  (-a, --all: list both remote-tracking and local branches)

# create a local branch that tracks a remote branch
  git branch --track branch_name origin/branch_name
  git checkout -b branch_name origin/branch_name
  (create a local branch that tracks a remote branch, and then switch to the local branch)

# delete a local branch
  git branch -d local_branch

# git fetch: download objects and refs from another repository
  git fetch upstream: fetch original remote repo
  git fetch origin: fetch personal remote repo
  git fetch --all: fetch all remotes (origin and upstream)

# git pull: fetch from and merge with a local branch
  git pull upstream: fetch original remote repo and merge with local branch
  git pull origin: fetch personal remote repo and merge with local branch
  git pull --all: fetch all remotes (origin and upstream) and merge with local branch

# git checkout: switch branches or restore working tree files
  git checkout -f [branch]
  -f, --force: proceed even if the index or the working tree differs from HEAD,
               used to throw away local changes

# git reset: reset current HEAD to the specified state
  git reset HEAD filename: unstage a staged modified file
  git reset HEAD: unstage all staged modified files
  git reset --hard HEAD~3: the last 3 versions: HEAD, HEAD^, and HEAD~2 are dropped

# differences of git fork and clone
  clone: clone a GitHub repo on local workstation
  (need to be declared as a contributor to contribute back to the remote repository,
   need to create a pull request)

  fork:
    1) clone a GitHub repo on the server side, i.e. clone a GitHub repo on your GitHub account
       (can make changes to that forked GitHub repo)
    2) can only contribute to the forked repo
    3) if want to contribute to the upstream (original) repo, you need to create a pull request
       to signal contribution back to the upstream repo
    
    Original (upstream/master)  --> Forked (origin/master)

# answering a pull request: merge devel branch into master branch
  Step 1)
    git fetch origin
    git checkout -b devel origin/devel
    git merge master
  Step 2)
    git checkout master
    git merge --no-ff devel (no fast-forward when merging)
    git push origin master (update on GitHub)

# show git log graph
  git log --graph --abbrev-commit --decorate
