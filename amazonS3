# Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) Basics:
  1) Amazon S3 stores data as objects within buckets
     an object consists of a file (optionally, any metadata that describes that file)
     buckets are the containers for objects, and there is an "unlimited" storage for each bucket
  2) When you upload a file, you can set permissions on the object (as well as any metadata)
  3) you can control access to it (who can create, delete, and list objects in the bucket)
     files can be served privately (via signed URLs), or
     files can be served publicly via an appropriately configured ACL (Access Control List) or ACP (Access Control Policy)
  4) you can view access logs for the bucket and its objects
  5) you can choose the geographical region where Amazon S3 will store the bucket and its contents

# Metadata vs. Tag
  1) Metadata is part of object and it is immutable, whereas Tag is not part of object
  2) Metadata will be returned in the HTTP headers, whereas Tags will not be returned in headers
  3) S3 encryption will not encrypt metadata and tag, so do NOT leave any digital footprint

# Restrictions
  1) No object locking
     if PUTs are simultaneously to the same key, the latest timestamp wins
  2) No atomic updates across keys
     you can not make the update of one key dependent on the update of another
