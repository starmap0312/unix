# differences of mTime, cTime, and aTime
  mTime: file "modify time" (when update the contents of file, ex. echo "new" > filename)
  cTime: inode/file "change time" (when update the file attributes, ex. permission of files,
      the owner, moving the file to other filesystem; note that when update the content
      of a file, both mTime and cTime will change)
  aTime: file "access time" (when the file is last accessed, ex. edit file, use head/cat/grep
      or sort commands to access a file)

# Network Time Servers (NTP)
  Sync Your Linux Server Time with Network Time Servers (NTP)

  1) start ntp daemon
     sudo service ntpd start
  2) check ntpd status
     chkconfig --list ntpd   ==> check if ntpd is configured to run at system start
     ntpq -p                 ==> check if ntp is running
     ex.
       remote           refid      st t when poll reach   delay   offset  jitter

     ntpstat                 ==> obtain a brief status report from ntpd
     ex.
