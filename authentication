# cookies
  1) a small piece of data (< 4KB, often a string of 100 Bytes) stored in the browser for a website
     the server sends back the response with a cookie data when the browser visits the website (in HTTP header)
     then everytime the browser makes requests to the website, it sends the cookie back
  2) temporary information represented by name=value
     ex. user_id=882063 (indicating that your computer has logined in the website as user_id=882063)
  3) uses of cookies
     a) storing login information
     b) storing small amounts of data to avoid hitting a database
     c) tracking user for ads
  4) browser limits
     a) at most 20 cookies per website

# cookie headers
  cookies are sent by HTTP headers
  ex. HTTP Response
    Set-Cookie: user_id=882063          (name=value, value < 4 KB) ==> can have multiple cookies set
    Set-Cookie: last_seen=Dec 25, 1995  (name=value, value < 4 KB)     headers do not need to be unique

  ex. HTTP Request (browser visits the website later)
    Cookie: user_id=822063;last_seen=Dec 25, 1995                  ==> all cookies separated by ;

  ex. Cookie Domains
    response:
      Set-Cookie: name=steve;Domain=ide.example.com;Path=/foo
      (Domain: what domain this cookie is relevant to)
      (Path: what path the cookie is relevant to, ex. /, all paths)
        note: only ide.example.com or other.ide.example.com domains can set the above cookie
              ide.example.com domain cannot set the cookie domain as www.google.com
    request:
      Cookie: name=steve;Domain=ide.example.com;Path=/foo
        note: the cookie can only be sent to ide.example.com or other.ide.example.com domains

  ex. Cookie expiration
    Set-Cookie: user=123;Expires=Tue, 1 Jan 2025 00:00:00 GMT
    (if no Expires parameter in the cookie, the cookie will expire when closing the browser, i.e. session cookie)
    when logining websites, usually there is a check box of "Remember Me"; if you check the box, the Expires
      parameter will be set in the cookie, which specifies the expiration of the cookie to some datetime 

# Cookie hashing
  for security reason, a parameter value is paired with a hash value which only the server knows how to compute
  i.e. Set-Cookie: name=value,[HASH]
       hash functions:
       H(<SECRET>+value) = [HASH]  ==> only the server knows the <SECRET>, hash function H can be md5, sha1, etc.
       HMAC(<SECRET>, value): use python hmac algorithm/module: hashed-based message authentication code
  ex.
    Set-Cookie: visits=6,2a59cff14c252fcec1cc30edbef364abfef324f3
    (the server can verify by the [HASH] if the cookie value is forged)
