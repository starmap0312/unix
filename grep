# grep (global regular expression print) command:
  grep -v pattern: invert match / exclude pattern
  grep -c pattern: return count of matched lines
  grep -A 3 pattern: output 3 lines after matched context
  grep -B 3 pattern: output 3 lines before matched context
  grep -C 3 pattern: output 3 lines surround matched context
  grep -i pattern: case insensitive,  ex. grep -i error, matching "Error", "erROr", "ERROR"
  grep -w pattern filename: search whole word in a file, i.e. grep '\<keyword\>' filename
  grep -n pattern filename: display line number
  grep --color pattern filename: highlight matching with colors
  grep -l pattern *.txt: display only filenames with matching pattern
  grep -R, -r pattern /path/to/folder/: recursively grep files in target directory
  grep -e pattern: protect a pattern beginning with a hyphen (-); otherwise, it will be escaped
    ex. echo "-A" | grep -e "-A"
  grep -E "^pattern1|^pattern2" / egrep "^pattern1|^pattern2": interpret pattern as extended regexp 
  grep -q "pattern" && <command>: quiet (no output to stdout), used to execute the second command
    if the pattern is greped

# regular expressions:
  the following characters are of special meaning
  ^ (carat): match the beginning of a line
  $ (dollar sign): match the end of a line
  \<keyword\> (escaped angle brackets): match a word, surrounded by white spaces, punctuation,
      or line beginnings and endings
  modifier: * (match >= 0 times), ? (match 0 or 1 time), + (match >= 1 times ),
      {n} (match n times), {n,} (match >= n times), {n,m} (match >= n, <= m times)
  [] (brackets): match any the enclosed characters, ex. [aeiou], [0-9](hypen - for range)
  [^]: match any character except the enclosed characters, ex. [^0-9] match non-digit

  note that the meta-characters ?, +, {, }, |, (, ), <, > lose their special meaning when
      use grep. if grep ?, +, {, }, |, (, ), you are actually match them literally
      escape them \?, \+, \{, \}, \|, \(, \), \<, \> to apply their special meaning
      alternatively, use egrep (extended grep), grep -E (no needs to escape symbols)
          (moreover, egrep accepts multi-pattern by concatenating patterns using |)
      in contrast, ^(begins with), $(ends with), .(wildcard), [, ] has special meaning, so
      escape them \^, \$, \., \[, \] to match them literally

  ex. 1. match email addresses: grep '[A-Za-z0-9_.%]\+@[A-Za-z0-9_.%]\+\.[A-Za-z]\+'
                                egrep '[A-Za-z0-9_.%]+@[A-Za-z0-9_.%]+\.[A-Za-z]+'
      2. match 3-5 digits: grep '[0-9]\{3,5\}'
                           egrep '[0-9]{3,5}'

# how to grep phone number pattern in a file, i.e. (xxx) xxx-xxxx or xxx-xxx-xxxx?
  egrep '^[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{4}$|^\([0-9]{3}\) [0-9]{3}-[0-9]{4}$' filename
  egrep '^([0-9]{3}-){2}[0-9]{4}$|^\([0-9]{3}\) [0-9]{3}-[0-9]{4}$' filename
