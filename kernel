# where are the kernel modules located?
  /lib/modules/<kernel-version>: all kernel modules or compiled drivers
  use command lsmod to view all installed kernel modules

# how to change kernel parameters?
  edit: /etc/sysctl.conf
  sysctl -p (make the changes permanently without rebooting)

# file handle limits
  limits on the number of open files
  kernel has built-in limits on the number of files that a process can open
    1) current limit: cat /proc/sys/fs/file-max
    2) raise the limit at run-time: sysctl -w fs.file-max=100000 (need root privilege)
    3) make the change permanantly
       edit /etc/sysctl.conf ==> fs.file-max = 100000
       sysctl -p             ==> let the change take effect

# socket tuning
   set up the numbers of concurent sessions of a server
   ex. with a large number of clients comnunicating with your server,
       the server may have a 20,000 open sockets or more
       one can increase that range by editing /etc/sysctl.conf
  1) the maximum number of "backlogged sockets"
     edit /etc/sysctl.conf
     net.core.somaxconn = 1024 (default: 128)
     (trade-off: slow connections)
     sysctl -p                ==> let the change take effect
