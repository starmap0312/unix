# create linux user
  1) useradd username ==> create users with default configurations
  2) adduser username ==> create users interactively
  3) newusers filename ==> create bulk users from file (the same format as /etc/passwd)

# what is user profile file?
  $HOME/.bash_profile, $HOME/.bash_bashrc

# how to show user info?
  finger <username>

# how to lock user password
  usermod -L username
  passwd -d username (remove user's password, user can login without password)

# add users to sudoers
  1) visudo (need to login as root or su)
  2) add a line: username ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

# sudo
  sudo -v: validate, sudo will update the user’s cached credentials, authenticating the user’s
           password if necessary
           for the sudoers plugin, this extends the sudo timeout for another 5 minutes but 
           does not run a command

# wheel: groupname
  1) Mac OS X and BSD UNIX
  2) for a group of trusted people that could become superuser by using the su command
  3) only allow people in wheel group to become superuser using su. They chose the groupname 'wheel', supposedly reference to other systems that had WHEEL, possibly a reference to being a 'big wheel'

It's less important now that you have the GUI authorization popups and sudo. You can use sudo without being in wheel group I believe.

As far as how to change to wheel, chgrp should be your friend, once you're root.
