# create linux user
  1) useradd username    ==> create user with default configurations
     userdel -r username ==> delete user
       -r, --remove: user home directory and mail spool will be removed (default is to keep)
  2) adduser username ==> create users interactively
  3) newusers filename ==> create bulk users from file (the same format as /etc/passwd)

# what is user profile file?
  $HOME/.bash_profile, $HOME/.bash_bashrc

# how to show user info?
  finger <username>

# how to lock user password
  usermod -L username
  passwd -d username (remove user's password, user can login without password)

# add users to sudoers
  1) visudo (need to login as root or su)
  2) add a line: username ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

# sudo
  1) validate:
    sudo -v: validate, sudo will update the user’s cached credentials, authenticating the user’s
             password if necessary; this extends the sudo timeout for another 5 minutes but 
             does not run a command
  2) run command as <username>
    sudo -su <username> -H [command]
      -u user: run the specified command as a user other than root
      -H: HOME, set the HOME environment variable to the home directory of the target user (default)
      -s [command]: runs the shell specified by the SHELL environment variable (i.e. /etc/passwd)
                    if no command is specified, an interactive shell is executed
    sudo sh -c "<command>": runs the commands in a sub-shell
    su - <username> -c '<command>': execute only one command as username
    sudo -u <username> <command>
  3) switch to <username>
    a) sudo:
      sudo -iu <username> OR sudo su - <username>
        -i: simulate initial login, source file .profile will be read (NOT .bashrc), start at $HOME folder
            runs the shell specified in the /etc/passwd entry of the target user as a login shell
        -u: let sudo run the specified command as username other than root
      sudo -su <username> 
        -s: runs the shell, source file .bashrc will be read (NOT .profile), does not start at $HOME folder
    b) su: substitute user identity
      su - username
        switch to username by entering username's password
      sudo su - username
        switch to username by entering the superuser's (sudoer) password
      sudo su -
        switch to root by entering the superuser's (sudoer) password
        by default, only users in the admin / wheel / sudoer groups can switch to UID 0 (root)

# wheel: groupname
  1) Mac OS X and BSD UNIX
  2) for a group of trusted people that could become superuser by using the su command
  3) only allow people in wheel group to become superuser using su
