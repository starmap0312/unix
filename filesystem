# "stale file handle" error
  when a directory is deleted, the inode for that directory (and the inodes for its contents) are recycled
    so the pointer your shell has to that directory inode (and its contents inodes) are now no longer valid
  if you attempt to access the contents of the directory, you may get a "stale file handle" erro message due to nonexistence of data
