# /var/spool/cron/: individual user crontab file location
  cron searches the spool area /var/spool/cron/ for crontab files
  crontab -e: edits the corresponding file in /var/spool/cron
  1) CentOS: /var/spool/cron/
     ex. /var/spool/cron/username
  2) Ubuntu: /var/spool/cron/crontabs/

# /etc/cron.d: modular crontab file location
  the cron entries have an additional field for a user to run the cron entries as
  (same as a systemwide /etc/crontab file)
  ex. /etc/cron.d/raid-check 
    # Run system wide raid-check once a week on Sunday at 1am by default (run as root)
    0 1 * * Sun root /usr/sbin/raid-check

# check user's cron job
  crontab -l -u username (cat /var/spool/cron/crontabs/username)
