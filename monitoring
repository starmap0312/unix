# what is load average in a linux?
  the average sum of the number of process waiting in the run queue and the number of process
    currently executing over the period of 1, 5, and 15 minutes
  use top and uptime command to find out the load average

# how to check memory and cpu stats?
  memory: free and vmstat commands
    ex. free, free -k, free -m, free -g (in bytes, kilo bytes, mega bytes, giga bytes)
  cpu: sar command

# sar: System Activity Reporter, part of the sysstat package (sar/iosstat/pidstat/nfsiostat...)
  1) monitor system real time performance (cpu, memory, i/o, etc.)
  2) collect performance data in the background and do analysis on the historical data 
     for bottlenecks
  3) logs are kept in /var/log/sysstat/ or /var/log/sa/
     log filename: /var/log/sa/sa[dd]
     [dd]: day of month, i.e. 01-30
  ex.
    sar -u 1 3          ==> system cpu statistics 3 times with 1 second interval
    sar -b 1 3          ==> i/o statistics 3 times with 1 second interval
    sar -r 1 3          ==> memory statistics 3 times with 1 second interval
    sar -n <DEVICE> 1 3 ==> network statistics (DEVICE: network devices such as eth0, eth1, etc.)
    sar -f /var/log/sa/sa$(date +%d -d yesterday) ==> display yesterday's statistics

# tcpdump: a network packet analyzer
  allows us to save the packets captured. one can use wireshark to read the tcpdump pcap files
  1) tcpdump -i eth0 (-i: interface): capture packets from an interface
  2) tcpdump -A -i eth0 (-A: in ASCII): display captured packets in ASCII
  3) tcpdump -w filename.pcap -i eth0: write captured packets to a file
  4) tcpdump -tttt -r filename.pcap: read captured packets from a saved file
     (-tttt: proper readable timestamp)

# ntop: display network usage, a top-like utility for monitoring network traffic
  ntop: display network traffic statistics

# nagios: an open source monitoring tool
  ex. monitor databases, hardwares (ex. disk partition becomes 80% full), services (ex. nfs),
      webservers, etc.

# iostat: reports cpu, disk i/o, nfs statistics, part of sar utility
  ex.
  iostat
    avg-cpu:  %user   %nice %system %iowait  %steal   %idle
               1.14    0.00    0.38    0.25    0.49   97.74

    Device:            tps   Blk_read/s   Blk_wrtn/s   Blk_read   Blk_wrtn
    vda               5.71       128.90       126.36    2703210    2649832
    vdb               0.02         0.17         0.00       3642          0

  iostat -c ==> display only cpu usage
  iostat -d ==> display only disk i/o statistics
  iostat -n ==> display only network statistics
  iostat -p sda ==> display i/o statistics for only a device (/dev/sda)

# dstat
  ex. dstat
    ----total-cpu-usage---- -dsk/total- -net/total- ---paging-- ---system--

# vmstat: reports virtual memory statistics (memory and swap usage), part of sar utility
  ex.
  vmstat ==> display information such as used/free virtual memory, memory swapped from/to disk,
             interrupts per second, context switches, blocks in/out per second
  vmstat 2 10 ==> execute 10 times with 2 seconds interval

# mpstat: reports processors statistics
  ex.
  mpstat -A ==> display all information
  mpstat -P ALL ==> display statistics of all individual CPUs or cores
  mpstat -P 0 ==> display statistics of a particular CPU

# free: display information of physical and swap memory
  free -m: display the values in MB (default: KB)
  swap: a virtual memory created on disk to increase RAM size virtually
  ex.
          total  used  free  shared  buffers  cached
    Mem:  8027   4377  3650  0       103      1630
    -/+ buffers/cache: 2643  5384
    Swap: 15624  608   15015

    total Mem: total available RAM of the machine
    used Mem:  used RAM space, including buffers and cached data size
    free Mem: free RAM space
    shared Mem: shared memory (obselete)
    buffers Mem: RAM space buffered by different applications
      a temporary location to store data for a particular application
      ex. when send burst of data through network, if the network interface is capable of sending
          less data, it will keep the data in the buffers 
    cached Mem: RAM space used for caching of data for future purpose
      a temporary location to store frequently used data for faster access
    (the difference between buffers and cached is that cache can be used multiple times, whereas
     buffers is used only one time. both are temporary for your data processing)
    - buffers/cache: 2643 (actual used RAM) = 4377 (used RAM) - 103 (buffers) - 1630 (cached)
    + buffers/cache: 5384 (actual available RAM) = 8027 (total RAM) - 2643 (actual used RAM)

# top: display processes in order of cpu usage
  press M: sorted by memory usage
  top -u username: display processes belonging to username
  top -p 1309,1882: display processes of particular PIDs

# lsof: list open files
  find out which processes are using a particular file
  lsof: list down PID of all the process which is using a particular file
    (COMMAND: process name, NAME: full path of open file, PID, USER, FD: file descriptor)
  lsof -u username: display open files of a particular user
  lsof filename: display users currently using filename
    (ex. /usr/bin/vim ==> display users currently using vim)
  lsof -n: inhibits the conversion of network numbers to host names for network files (run faster)

# w: who is logged on the system

# uptime
  system uptime, number of users logged on, load average (avg. load of 1 min/5 mins/15 mins)
    ex.
      08:32:51 up 76 days, 20:39,  7 users,  load average: 39.72, 38.29, 35.46

  /proc/loadavg: system's workload for last 15 minutes

    ex. 0.14 0.22 0.19 1/342 32096

      0.14 0.22 0.19: averaged cpu load over 1, 5, and 15 minutes
      1/342: ratio for the number of executing kernel scheduling entities (processes, threads)
             currently executing / currently exist on the system 
      32096: PID of the process that was most recently created on the system 

# /proc: virtual filesystem
  numbered directories: information about processes of particular PIDs
  (sub-directories: cmd)
  system information files: ex. cpuinfo, meminfo, loadavg, etc.

# /etc/cron.d/: crontab daemon job
  ex. /etc/cron.d/sysstat
    # Run system activity accounting tool every 10 minutes
    */10 * * * * root /usr/lib64/sa/sa1 1 1
    # Generate a daily summary of process accounting at 23:53
    53 23 * * * root /usr/lib64/sa/sa2 -A
  
    1) logging program: /usr/lib64/sa/sa2
    2) write a daily report in the /var/log/sa directory, ex. /var/log/sa/sa31
    3) use sar to read the log file: ex. sar -f /var/log/sa/sa31
