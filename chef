# Chef resource
  1) one part of the system, ex. a file, a template, or a package
  2) a part of the system and its desired state, ex. a package that should be installed, a service that
     should be running, or a file that should be generated
  3) every resource in Chef has a default action
     file resource has a default action ":create"  (create a file)
     ex.

     file 'motd' do
       content 'hello world'
     end


     file 'motd' do
       action :create
       content 'hello world'
     end

     other actions: install a package, and start a service
  4) resource attributes: can be ordered arbitrary
     ex.
       file '/etc/motd' do
         owner 'root'          <== resource attribute can be put in front of action
         group 'root'
         mode '0755'
         action :create
       end

# Chef recipe: recipes organize resources
  1) a file that groups related resources, ex. everything needed to configure a web server, database server, or
     a load balancer
  2) a collection of resources that describes a particular configuration or policy
     i.e. it describes everything that is required to configure part of a system
          install and configure software components
          manage files
          deploy applications
     ex.
       package 'httpd'                <== default action for package resource is install

       service 'httpd' do             <== specify the action for service resource to be enable, start
         action [:enable, :start]         i.e. enables the service when the system boots, then starts it
       end

       file '/var/www/html/index.html' do  <== create a file resource of webpage
         content '<html>
         <body>
             <h1>hello world</h1>
         </body>
       </html>'
       end

  2) use chef-client in local mode to apply that recipe from the command line
     i.e. chef-client --local-mode filename.rb
  3) Chef applies resources in the order they appea

# Chef cookbook: make your recipe more manageable
  1) provides structure to your recipes and enables you to more easily reference external files
     i.e. a cookbook helps you stay organized.
