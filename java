# Java Remote Method Invocation (Java RMI)
  1) Java API that performs remote method invocation
  2) the object-oriented equivalent of remote procedure calls (RPC)
  3) support for direct transfer of serialized Java classes and distributed garbage collection
  4) due to the REMOTE part of RMI, most implimentations also make it trivial for remote
     actors to execute commands to gain access to the system and therefore utilization
     should be restricted with the the assumption that anyone that can access the RMI
     registery theoritically can obtain direct access to the system
