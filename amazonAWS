# What Is IAM (Identity and Access Management)
  1) Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources
     Manage user access and encryption keys
  2) you use IAM to control who is authenticated (signed in) and authorized (has permissions) to use resources
  ex. you can create a IAM role that you would like to obtain temporary credentials for, and then
      you can setup a trust relationship for that role whenever someone presents a temporary credential

# What are IAM roles?
  1) a secure way to grant permissions to entities that you trust
     examples of entities:
       IAM user in another account
       application code running on an EC2 instance that needs to perform actions on AWS resources
       an AWS service that needs to act on resources in your account to provide its features
       users from a corporate directory who use identity federation with SAML
  2) IAM roles issue keys that are valid for short durations, making them a more secure way to grant access
