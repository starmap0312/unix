# what is TCP/IP?
  a set of networking protocols used to construct global internet

# does IP protect data on the network?
  IP leaves all issues of data protection to the transport protocal. both TCP and UDP have
    have mechanisms that guarantee that the data they deliver to an application is correct.
  IP layer deals with the correct destination of packets, whereas the transport layer(TCP/
    UDP/SCTP) checks if the data are delivered correctly using checksum mechanism.

# what is the data unit of transport layer?
  segment

# how data is sent by IP layer?
  packet

# can we detect a TCP connection has crashed?
  no. detecting crashed system over TCP/IP is difficult.

# what OSI and TCP/IP stand for?
  OSI: Open System Interconnection
  TCP/IP: Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol

# the four layers of TCP/IP stack, also called the DoD model, are Application/Process,
  Host-to-Host, Internet, and Network Access
    the Host-to-Host layer is equivalent to the Transport layer of the OSI model
    the Internet layer is equivalent to the Network layer of the OSI model

# SMTP/HTTP/FTP services use TCP, whereas DHCP/SNMP/TFTP use UDP
  both FTP and Telnet use TCP at the Transport layer; however, they both are Application
    layer protocols

# Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is used to send error messages through the network.
  every segment or ICMP payload must be encapsulated within an IP datagram (packet).

# Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is used to find hardware address from a known IP address

# DNS uses both TCP and UDP. DNS uses TCP for zone exchanges between servers and uses UDP
  when a client is trying to resolve a hostname to an IP address
